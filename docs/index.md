## Ansible Playbook to configure my laptops and desktops

I care about not having to think too much about my setup between machines.
Especially when I want to get right to work.

For that reason, it is very comfortable for me
to have the same base configuration
on each machine (look, feel,
keyboard shortcuts, core software, etc.).

### My journey to the current state of this repo

* I found a cool bash script on the internet (*I didn't understand most of it*) 🤷
* I modified cool bash script for my needs and it worked! 🚀
* I learned about Makefiles. 😄
* I proceeded to do everything with Makefiles. 🤩🤩🤩
* I got tired of running successive Make targets over and again 😐.
* I used Ansible at work and decided to take a course to learn more about it. 🤓
* I put off actually taking the plunge to use Ansible. 🕒🕕🕘🕛
* I finally took the plunge and decided to use Ansible for my configuration. ✔️

## Supported Ubuntu LTS Versions

* Ubuntu 18.04
* Ubuntu 20.04

> There are no plans to support non-LTS versions.
> Software (support) is LTS version dependent.

## Getting Started with this repo

### Makefile

The [Makefile](https://github.com/iancleary/ansible-desktop/blob/main/Makefile)  is the entry point.

### Common Utilty Scripts

The [scripts](https://github.com/iancleary/ansible-desktop/tree/main/scripts) folder contains common setup between local scripts and Travis-CI.

### Testing

Continuous Integration Testing is done with the
[.github/workflows/test.yml](https://github.com/iancleary/ansible-desktop/blob/main/.github/workflows/test.yml) file.

Multiple jobs test independent portions of the installation.

> While testing the playbook in order would be ideal,
> the preference here is to have the Continuous Integration
> finish faster.

### Linting

Linting is performed on common file types:

* YAML files with [yamllint](https://yamllint.readthedocs.io/)
* Bash files with [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/)
* Markdown files with [markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli)

--------------------------

## New Machine Setup

For a new machine, I run the following command
to set up my computer:

> Please make sure you adjust your hostname as Ansible keys off this variable.
> I like to do this during the initial configuration of the machine.

```bash
wget -qO- \
https://github.com/iancleary/ansible-desktop/raw/main/run.sh | \
bash
```

This will prompt you for your `sudo` password
for the bash script and then once later for
`ansible`'s "BECOME PASSWORD" prompt.

Voila! 🎉🎉🎉
